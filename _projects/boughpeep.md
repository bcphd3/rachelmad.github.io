For our App Design and Entrepreneurship class, our group created ProudParent, a baby book for the modern age.
The fictional start up aimed to cater to young mothers eager to chronicle their baby's lives. 
I was responsible for the app's integration with Microsoft Azure to store user information. 
As the business lead, I also interviewed potential customers and did product pitches.
