Every Thursday, I'll feature a tech blog I like. 
Today, that's Tom Preston-Werner's, 
cofounder and former CEO of Github and creator of Jekyll.

<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/">tom.preston-werner.com</a>

<p>
It's probably fitting to feature the blog of the 
<a href="jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> creator and Github CEO 
as this blog is built and hosted on those two. 
I stumbled upon his blog since it was the first on the list of 
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">sites built with Jekyll</a>. 
He doesn't have quite as much content as many other tech blogs, 
but the posts he's written are still great.
</p>

<p>
In one piece, he recalls how GitHub got started and how 
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/10/18/how-i-turned-down-300k.html"> he turned down 
<emphasize>$300,000</emphasize> from Microsoft</a> to work on it. 
He describes how it was a simple idea, like most things. 
But looking at the great community it's developed now, 
it's great to hear about its early beginnings.
</p>

<p>
He also wrote about 
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html"> why he created Jekyll</a>.
This post is even more interesting to me as a techie-but-wannabe-writer. 
Source control is so irreplacable in development today that it's surprising that it doesn't exist for writers. 
And as a Jekyll user myself, it's nice to see the thoughts that went into it. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, I had to 
<a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> 
<a href="http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">Readme Driven Development</a> 
because it was such a fresh perspective. 
I love how he jokes about Agile vs Waterfall and discusses their pitfalls. 
I'll have to admit, I don't keep my ReadMe's updated, if I have them at all, 
but it's an interesting idea and I'm curious to see if anyone has ever tried it.
