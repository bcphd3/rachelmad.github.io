<h6>What is Material Design Lite</h6>
<a href="https://material.google.com/">Material Design</a> is a set of design principles created by Google. 
<a href="https://getmdl.io/index.html">Material Design Lite</a> is an easy way to add Material Design aesthetics to your site. 

<h6>1. Get a Material Design Lite template</h6>
<p>
Head on over to <a href="https://getmdl.io/templates/index.html">the Material Design Lite site</a> and find a template you like. 
I picked the Portfolio template, as it exactly describes what I wanted to do with my Github Page: a simple portfolio site to showcase
my resume, projects, and even a blog. Download the template you like.

<h6>2. Create Jekyll default layout</h6>
<p>
Jekyll uses layouts to wrap posts. The default layout is used for all pages of the site.
