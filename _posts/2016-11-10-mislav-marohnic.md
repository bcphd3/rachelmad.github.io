For this week's Tech Blog Thursday, 
I want to talk about Mislav Marohnic, 
who's blog wins my most number of pocketed entries. 

<a href="http://mislav.net/">mislav.net</a>

<p>
There isn't much that can be found online about Mislav Marohnic 
other than his employment at 
<a href="https://github.com/">Github</a>, 
his open source contributions for Ruby plug ins, 
and his <i>really good blog</i>. 
This is another blog I stumbled upon on the list of 
<a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/wiki/Sites">sites built with Jekyll</a>. 
Unfortunately, he hasn't updated in quite a while. 
But nevertheless, his posts are always a great read. 
</p>

<p>
Remember my 
<a href="">post on Git</a>
and how I like to 
<a href="http://mislav.net/2013/02/merge-vs-rebase/">rebase interactively</a>?
Well, I got it from him. 
The idea behind it is to keep the project's history clean and useful for others reading it. 
</p>

<p>
I also learned from him that 
<a href="http://mislav.net/2010/05/semicolons/">semicolons are optional in JavaScript</a>.
Did you know that? 
The post is old though, so it writes against minification. 
But it's likely that modern day tools for minification, linting, and transpiling will require semicolons. 
It's a cool fun fact though!
</p>

<p>
He does have a post I disagree with though. 
He doesn't like 
<a href="http://mislav.net/2012/06/line-numbers/">line numbers</a>. 
For blog posts, I think if the code blocks being explained are so long 
that the only way to talk about them are through line numbers, 
then they should be shorted or simplified. 
That said, I still like putting line numbers on my code blocks for styling purposes. 
</p>

<p>
However, I strongly disagree that you should disable line numbers when coding. 
What if you're explaining your code to a coworker or showing your code for a review?
Line numbers are helpful for plenty of reasons. 
</p>

<p>
Having said that, I enjoyed his blog. 
I may disagree on some posts, but that's a good thing. 
We don't want mere echo chambers. 
So if you've got time, check out his blog.
