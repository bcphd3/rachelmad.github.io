After 2 weeks of featuring not-so-current blogs, 
this week I want to talk about David Walsh's blog. 

<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/">DavidWalsh.name</a>

<p>
David Walsh is a web developer at Mozilla and a 
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/about-david-walsh">bunch of other things</a>. 
I found his blog browsing through 
<a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket's</a> recommendations once, 
and I've been reading his posts ever since. 
</p>

<p>
He's written more technical articles that help keep me up to date and constantly learning. 
Some of the more recent ones I've liked are on
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/es6-features">ES6 features</a>, 
and its follow-up on 
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/javascript-function-parameters">require parameters</a>. 
I love how I can immediately see the value of the 
<code>find</code> and <code>findIndex</code> methods he mentions.
Though I wonder if throwing errors if a parameter isn't passed is still a big issue, 
since most IDEs will highlight errors like that anyway. 
</p>

<p>
I also love his post on
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/being-a-dev-dad">being a dad</a>.
Many developers right now spend a great chunk of their time prioritizing development. 
And while I see great value in that, 
I like seeing the perspective of successful developers who choose to have more of a balance. 
</p>

<p>
But really my favorite post is on the 
<a href="https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>.
It's a problem plenty of us have. 
Between interviews that expect you to master every topic on software development 
and the constant challenge to write the cleanest, most reusable code possible,
I certainly feel it often. 
But here is a smart and successful developer admitting that he has it too. 
Even better, he explains why we shouldn't feel like imposters, 
and believe it or not, it helps.
