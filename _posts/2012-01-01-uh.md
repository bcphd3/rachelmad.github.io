Our curriculum was primarily based on C++, C#, and Java.
I took classes on all the essentials, including Data Structures and Algorithms,
Databases (using SQL), and Operating Systems. My favorite classes were Software Design,
where we learned about Design Patterns and best practices, and Application Design and Entrepreneurship,
where we created a start up, interviewed potential customers, and pitched our ideas,
following the Lean Canvas business model.
