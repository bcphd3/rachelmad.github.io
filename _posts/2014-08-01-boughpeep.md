For our App Design and Entrepreneurship class, our group created Boughpeep, a baby book for the modern age.
The fictional start up aimed to cater to young mothers eager to chronicle their baby's lives. I was responsible
for the app's integration with Microsoft Azure to store user information. As the business lead, I also did
product pitches.
