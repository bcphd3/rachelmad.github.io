On the first day of November, I challenged myself to 30 days of writing. 
Not just any kind of writing either, I wanted to do 30 days of tech blogging. 
If you look at this blog, you'll see that I clearly didn't finish that, 
I did learn quite a few things though.

<h6>In depth understanding of different concepts</h6>
<p>
I covered a range of concepts, from 
<a href="/entries/2016/11/02/primitive-input-changes">Angular</a>, to 
<a href="/entries/2016/11/04">Git mistakes</a>, to 
<a href="/entries/2016/11/06">Jekyll</a>, 
and while have a general understanding of these topics, 
I'm still no expert. 
Writing about them forced me to dive deep into why things worked the way they did. 
Along the way, I learned plenty, like change detection, 
and new git commands. 
</p>

<h6>How to talk technically</h6>
<p>
I've always taken pride in being able to translate technical terms 
into simpler ones that non-developers can understand. 
Mostly, because I don't like throwing around technical terms as I speak. 
Writing about programming forced me to add them into my vernacular, 
and more importantly, it forced me to be more confident in using them. 
</p>

<h6>How to write better</h6>
<p>
I didn't want to write just for the sake of it. 
I made sure each entry was grammatically and technically correct. 
I also wanted it to be just the right length. 
As they say, it should be like a mini skirt; 
short enough to keep people's interest, 
but long enough to cover the important parts. 
</p>

<h6>Reading even more often</h6>
<p>
I read a lot. 
But this past month, 
I read between builds, in the elevators, and while waiting in line. 
It was a great eye opener on how much idle time I had and how to fill it. 
</p>

<h6>30 days of blogging isn't sustainable</h6>
<p>
A mere 10 days into the challenge, 
I learned that writing technical pieces daily wasn't sustainable just yet. 
There's so much more for me to learn before I write about them, 
and the number of topics I could confidently cover did not keep pace with my daily writing.
