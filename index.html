<div class="mdl-cell mdl-card__supporting-text padding-top">
    Iâ€™m Rachel, I do calligraphy, ballroom dancing, and indoor skydiving. <br>
    <br>
    More importantly, I'm a software developer based in Houston, Texas, where I do front end development at National Oilwell Varco.
    I use Angular 2 and TypeScript at my job daily, and I love playing around with Python on the side.
