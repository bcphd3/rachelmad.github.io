<div class="padding-top">
    <p>
        Iâ€™m Rachel, I do calligraphy, ballroom dancing, and indoor skydiving.
    </p>
    <p>
        More importantly, I'm a software developer based in Houston, Texas, where I do full stack web development at National Oilwell Varco.
        I use Angular 2, TypeScript, and C# at my job daily. 
        And I'm currently obsessing over the many JavaScript frameworks like Ionic 2 and React during my free time.
